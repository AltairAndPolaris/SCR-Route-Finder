# SCR-Route-Finder

*WARNING - This website does not contain the informations for the newest version of SCR. Support for version 2.3 is planned for late January.*

This is a website built for the game Stepford County Railway on Roblox.
Contains all stations and routes from SCR 2.2
The website can be found at https://altairandpolaris.github.io/SCR-Route-Finder/

It has been created for drivers and passengers to find the routes leading to different stations.
The current features are
- Three modes of pathfinding, including balanced, most direct, and cheapest.
- A per-station cost calculator
- Route indications for drivers

Planned features :
- A random station generator for Tag games
- A connection with the game for time and current available routes (not sure i can do that)
- EXP and Point rate per routes
- A train/route compatibility overlay when you click on the route.

Have fun with my little website. I may take a bit long to respond to bug reports or requests, but i'm always trying to work on it.
